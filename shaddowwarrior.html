					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p>This is a contest I won on <a href="https://www.freelancer.com/u/Jovantehill.html">Freelancer.com</a>. He needed a non-responsive single page site that had a ninja theme (as his service that he was providing was called "Shadow Warrior") and only using HTML and CSS. I used dark colors along with ninja style pictures that gave the site the theme he was looking for. I used a carousel to display the reviews he had from his customer of the first section you see as I wanted people to see good things when they came to the site. Since he only wanted a single page I created the effect of multiple pages using scrollable effects and overlays that were also accessible using the navigation links above.I also added a footer with social media icon links to his different social pages.</p>
