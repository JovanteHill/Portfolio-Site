					<h2>Description:</h2>
					<p>This was a personal project I did for a friend who has a photography business. I had no requirements and he just let me do what I felt was right. I used a carousel to cylce through 4 of what I thought were his best conservative pictures that would capture a potential clients eye. Below his logo, navigaion links were used to cycle thru to the different pages. On the gallery page I used Javascript to create a light-box and a zoom effect to display the thumbnail in full resolution when an onclick event was triggered. While in the light-box mode you can click on the next image in the row and cycle that way. Included in the footer was round icons that link to his social media pages.</p>
